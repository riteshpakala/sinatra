## Objectives
- Understanding a securities' expected trend for the following trading days.
- Adapting data analysis to personal trading strategies. To either validate one's own existing premonitions or in creating new ones.
- Developing a sharper sense of technical indicators via handling the calculations and expectations of the various combinations that would lead to a manually drawn hypothesis of a securities' future.

An easy way to visualize what is happening is by creating a simple matrix like the table above. The left most side, has indicators that we refer to as the ***Defaults***. These indicators will never change, and are defined as stable pivots that will support the distinctions the machine draws from 2 of the indicators we see on the top most columns.

Each node-link diagram is a representation of 2 of the ***NOT***-default indicators that were picked with the 4 ***default*** indicators predicting the closest price of the last known available price for the chosen security.

#### What does this mean?

In the scatter plot, we see every individual iterations our ***Support Vector Machine*** went through and their outcomes versus the actual price of the security. Lot's of predictions heavily weighed towards one end can show a clear trend building up in the future for the stock's price. If there's many dots below the ***green line*** we can expect a fall in price, and vica versa.

The indicators chosen to be paired with the ***default*** indicators, can tell us why. 

#### Meaning

If ***RSI*** and ***Stochastic D.*** were chosen to support the default indicators, we can tell that the security has clear patterns relative to ***momentum*** within the days chosen to train that particular model.

That is because, RSI or (Relative Strength Index), is a momentum indicator. It identifies the bias an order book has, either towards buyers or sellers, the same goes with Stochastic D.. Stochastic D., is a moving average of the Stochastic K. sometimes more precise when identifying momentum changes. It's not a surprise if these 2 were paired, because Stochastics also identifies the over buying or selling nature of a particular security. Except in different way, like getting a paper peer reviewed by 2 different parties, whom both end up with the same critique. Inadvertently defininf the paper's conciseness and accurateness, validating each reviewer and the writer itself simultaneously.

#### Days?

Each indicator requires a common variable. The days to look back into the past in determining the value of the indicator to your target date. So a ***Stochastic K. 14*** of today, would be all the closing prices of the past 2 weeks, used in calculating the ***Stochastic K.*** of today. And while we're here, the ***Stochastic D.*** would be the average of the 3 ***Stochastic K.s*** prior to each day the ***Stochastic K.*** was calculated for. But, that ***3*** is also a modifiable variable in our data visualization which you will be able to see when hovering over a Stochastic D. node.

The range of days chosen to pick from is ***4 days to 28 days*** in the past. With an iteration randomizing a day picked per indicator, per cycle. 

> If we had more computation power, we would be able to run an iteration to cover every possible combination and permutation. As well as more time, to await results and analyze the data.

For now, we are randomizing, which in itself is more effecient.

#### Visualization Guide

An iteration is made up of every combination of indicators where the default indicators do not change. At a max of 6 total indicators used per cycle of predictions. So that's 2 indicators picked from the pool available.

**Node Link Diagram:**
Of each of these cycles the best and most accurate prediction of the iteration event, is chosen to be displayed in the node-link diagram. Each of these node link's can account for 1 iteration of every combination exactly once. This results in a total of around ~20 cycles per iteration with our current set of indicators to pick from. ***So if there are 9 node-link diagrams we have run 9 iterations with a total of 180 cycles***.

**Scatter Plot:**
Each individual cycle is plotted, with their prediction outcome and a visual line of the actual price to compare with. Showing a detailed overview of the indicators paired and the days chosen along with it. 

This big picture view, will help us identify the machines observations when drawing disctinctinos through it's vectorization of all the data points. There could be a singular answer or everyone can have their own methodology, relevant to their trading habits. For simplicity, we will look at the weights of the points on either side of the green line and discover a potential momentum change of the security. If left of the green line, we can expect a fall in price, or a ***SELL SIGNAL***, and a ***BUY SIGNAL*** if the points are too the right of the green line.

**Line Plot:**
An interactable line graph of the chosen security, to show us a brief historical summary of factual momentum change of the security and validate predictions previewed on the node-link or scatter plot visualizations.

## Research Notes

****“In this paper we focus on a specific machine learning technique known as Support VectorMachines (SVM). Our goal is to use SVM at timetto predict****
 whether a given stock’s price is higher or lower on day t+m. “
